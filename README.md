Hi, I’m @MeSeurus

I'm a Java developer with Rocket Engineering background (not Rocket Science, by the way!)

For a long time I was no more then just an enthusiast in programming, tried to start with many languages - Python, C++,
but Java appeared to be the most suitable for me and the JVM in common: Scala - for Data Analysis; Kotlin - for Mobile Development. So I keeping
studying them all fulfilling at the same time the duties of:

- Junior Java Specialist in a Fin-Tech who faces new challenges at work everyday
- Post-Graduate student in BMSTU who desperately tries to write his PhD paper on Rocket Engines as soon as it is possible
- Japan Lover who studies at nights dreaming of working in Japan one day
- And the last but not the least - A musician, who is going to release his own album one day in style of viby 80-s

Getting back to the technical part of all this - I've been thinking a lot about the technological stack one beginning Java Junior need to learn. And that's what I came up with
(in brackets - highly recommended as well):

- Languages: Java, Scala, Kotlin (Python, JavaScript)
- Dev: Spring, Micronaut, Akka (Node.js, React/Angular - to be independent fullstack developer!!!), principles of REST, SOAP.
- Dev-Ops: Docker, Ansible, Kubernetes, Kafka.
- Databases and Storages: SQL/NoSQL, Elastic Stack.
- Data Analysis: Apache Spark, Strong mathematics //work in progress
- Cloud: Spring Cloud, AWS/Azure etc.

Well, I believe this list is hilarious at the moment, but that's from the point of Junior's view. Still long way to go. Wish me good luck! And in my turn
I wish you all to become the specialist you dream to be! (Or choose another option)
